# Code Foo React Refactor

## Instructions:
* Clone Repository
* run "npm install" or "yarn install"
* run "npm start" or "yarn start" (This will run the app in your browser)

## Description:
This is a refactor of the IGN grid and frontend projects I used as an application into the IGN CodeFoo program.  As much of the previous code was reused if possible.  This was an optional personal project that I decided to do to further my knowledge of React and Redux. 

## Grid:
Original grid project only required that we build an app that would create a random grid and display all possible combinations that added up to the area of the grid.  For instructions on how the grid should work please see. ( http://www.ign.com/code-foo/2017/ ) In this project using the functions created previously I created a React app with the additional functions:
* Ability to create new grid that randomly creates new random grid and show all possible new solutions.
* Clicking on the Grid Cells will allow you to manually try to find solutions that add up to the area.  Each time a cell is clicked it will show you all the cells that you have previously clicked, the current sum, the next cells that can picked and the possible solutions based on the cells that have been clicked. 
* Reset grid will allow you to find different possible solution for current grid.
* Display all answers will redisplay all possible solutions for grid.

## Frontend:
Refactor of original frontend project that was done with HTML, CSS, and jQuery.
